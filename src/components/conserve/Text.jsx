          Wildlife is a precious gift of God to this planet. The term ‘Wildlife’
          not only includes wild animals but also includes all undomesticated
          life forms including birds, insects, plants, fungi and even
          microscopic organisms. India is known all over the world for its
          wildlife and biodiversity richness. Wildlife conservation is an
          activity in which humans make cognizant efforts to protect plants and
          other animal species and their habitats. Conservation mainly focused
          on carrying capacity of area and intelligent use of natural resources,
          if they are excess or plenty their use should be permitted, but if the
          resources decrease, a strict monitoring and carrying capacity should
          be done.
